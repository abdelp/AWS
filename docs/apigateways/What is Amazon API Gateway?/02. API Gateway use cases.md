# API Gateway use cases

## Use API Gateway to create REST APIs

**What is an API Gateway REST API made up of?**

An API Gateway REST API is made up of:

* Resources
* Methods

**What is a resource?**

A resource is a logical entity that an app can access through a resource path.

**What's a method?**

A method corresponds to a REST API request that is submitted by the user of your API and the response returned to the user. A combination of a resource path and an operation identifies a method of the API.

**By what means does the API interface with the backend?**

The API interfaces with the backend by means of *integration requests* and *integration responses*.
