# Overview of AWS identity management: Users

**What is the main difference between IAM users and federate users?**

The main difference between the two is that IAM users are granted long-term credentials to your AWS resources while users in IAM Identity Center have temporary credentials that are stablished each time the user signs-in to AWS.

**As a best practice, what should you require to human users to access AWS?**

As a best practice, require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials insted of as an IAM user.

**What is a primary use for an IAM user?**

A primary use for IAM users is to give workloads that cannot use IAM roles the ability to make programmatic requests to AWS services using the API or CLI.

## First-time access only: Your root user credentials

**What can restrict the permissions that are granted to the root user?**

Only service control policies (SCPs) in organizations can restrict the permissions that are granted to the root user.
