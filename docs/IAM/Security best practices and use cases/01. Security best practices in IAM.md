# Security best practices in IAM

## Require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials

## Require workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access AWS

## Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## Update access key when needed for use cases that require long-term credentials

## Follow the practices to protect your root user credentials

## Apply least-privilige permission

## Get started with AWS managed policies and move toward least-privilige permission

## Use IAM Access Analyzer to generate least-privilege policies based on access activity

## Regularly review and remove unused users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials

## Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict access

## Verify public and cross-account access to resources with IAM Access Analyzer

## Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your IAM policies to ensure secure and functional permissions

## Establish permissions guardrails across multiple accounts

## Use permissions boundaries to delegate permissions management within an account
