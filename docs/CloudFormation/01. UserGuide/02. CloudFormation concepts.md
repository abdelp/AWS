### Topics

* Templates

## Templates

**What's a CloudFormation template?**

A CloudFormation template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file.

**How does CloudFormation use these templates?**

CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources.

**What do you specify when you create a stack?**

Whenever you create a stack, you also specify a template that CloudFormation uses to create whatever you described in the template.

## Stacks

**What is a CloudFormation stack?**

When you use CloudFormation, you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack.

**What you can do with a collection of resources?**

You can create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks.

**How are all the resources in a stack defined?**

All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template.

## Change sets

**What is a change set?**

A change set is a summary of your proposed changes in a stack.

**What do change sets allow you?**

Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running resources before implementing them.
