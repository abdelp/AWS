## Session management schema design

The decision between duplicating and storing constants as a separate attribute depends on certain factors:

* How often is the constant information read together with the variables? If frequent, it is better to duplicate attributes across items to aim for read efficiency
* How often are the common attributes updated? - If frequent, it is better to store these attributes as a separate item to target write efficiency
