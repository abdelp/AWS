## Establish a monitoring baseline

To establish a baseline you should, at a minimum, monitor the following items:

* The number of read or write capacity units consumed over the specified time period, so you can track how much of your provisioned throughput is used.

* Requests that exceeded a table's provisioned write or read capacity during the specified time period, so you can determine which request exceed the provisioned throughtput quotas of a table.

* System errors, so you can determine if any requests resulted in an error.
